<div>
  If set, and Jenkins is set to poll for changes, this repository will still
  not be checked for changes. It can be useful in jobs where you want to
  track changes and get latest commit but still don't want
  to trigger new builds based on those changes.
  <p/>
  This does not require a workspace.
  <p/>
  If no builds exists at all, this setting will not prevent a first build from
  being built.
